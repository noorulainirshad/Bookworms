# Bookworms
Bookworms is a Python and SQLite3 application designed for individuals passionate about books. Developed as a semester-long project for CSE-111 (Database Systems), the application allows users to create personalized lists of books, 
share feedback, and rate their favorite reads. Throughout the development process, we leveraged our understanding of database systems, focusing on querying, filtering, and modifying data using SQLite3. This project provided us 
with the opportunity to explore more advanced aspects of database manipulation, particularly features like triggers.

## Key Features
- **Book Lists:** Users can create and manage custom lists of books, facilitating organization and exploration of their literary preferences.

- **Feedback and Ratings:** Share your thoughts on books and assign personalized ratings, fostering a community-driven approach to book recommendations.

- **Data Source:** Book data is sourced from the Kaggle database named [Best Books (10k) Multi-Genre Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/best-books-10k-multi-genre-data), providing a diverse and extensive collection of 
books across genres.
